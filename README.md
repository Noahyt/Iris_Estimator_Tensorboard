# DatasetAPI_for_MNIST

There are not very many (easy to find) implemented examples of TensorFlowâ€™s Dataset API.  This example is completely redundant but shows how to use the dataset API in the familiar MNIST data.

We show the essential datasetAPI functions - creating a dataset and corresponding iterator.

We demonstrate  various options including batching, example modification (noise), and randomization.
